# 6. 3 Ways to Mitigate Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities

## En app/Models/Post.php

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

    class Post extends Model
    {
        use HasFactory;

        //protected $guarded = ['id']; //All are fillable except id

        //protected $guarded = []; //If we want to make all the fields mass assignable

        //protected $guarded = ['*']; //If we want to block all the fields from being mass-assigned

        protected $fillable = [
            'title',
            'excerpt',
            'body',
        ];
    }

## Correr comandos:

    sudo php artisan tinker

    use App\Models\Post;
    $post = new Post;
    $post->title = 'My Third Post';
    $post->excerpt = 'This is my third post guys omg this is so amazing';
    $post->body = '<p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>';
    $post->save();

    Post::create(['title' => 'My Fourth post', 'excerpt' => 'This is my fourth post guys omg this is so amazing', 'body' => '<p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

    $post = Post::first();
    $post->update(['excerpt' => 'This is my first post guys omg this is so awesome']);
